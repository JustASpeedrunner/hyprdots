#### LIST MAY NOT BE COMPLETE UNTIL FULL RELEASE

This will be installed in a later step, this is just to be transparent.

## Installation
Method 1 (Script):
- **Check back later, WIP**

Method 2 (Manual):
- Install whatever software you'd like, to be certain you've got the essentials check the keybinds in ``hypr/hyprland.conf`` and ensure everything that is used is installed.
- Git clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/JustASpeedrunner/hyprdots`
- Cd into the folder: `cd hyprdots`
- Copy the files into your .config folder: `cp -r .config/* ~/.config/`
- And you're done! 
  - Note: Some applications may need to restart before changes take effect, waybar and dunst being the main examples.

## Some things to note
I use Colemak as opposed to QWERTY, so my keybinds are in different places than you may expect them. I did set the keyboard layout to QWERTY in the dotfiles but I didn't change the keybinds to where they would be on Colemak, so by all means change them to your liking.

Also, I am on a laptop so my monitor setup will be different from yours, change the config accordingly in `hypr/hyprland.conf` and in `hypr/hyprpaper.conf`.
